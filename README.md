# 3D game engine

## Start main.py and enjoy! 

Wasd+space+shift - position controls (ctrl to move twice as fast),
arrow keys - camera controls,
"g" - print current position and camera facing vector to terminal, 
"y" - display sed parameters on screen.

## Make your own points and connections
In main.py you can set your own points in the list "points" using the class
Point(x, y, z).

In main.py you can set the connections between vertecies
using a tuple of size two with indexes of first and second points in
the list "points".

If the game is rendering slowly, you can calibrate the FPS in constants.py
to some lower value.

## Updates coming soon!
